##Introduction (h2)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an open source text editor developed by Microsoft and is free to use.
It's known for being relatively lightweight while also incorporating key features
found in modern IDE's such as Git integration and an extensive debugger. This makes
VS Code great for anything from simple Python scripting to denser software engineering
projects.

##Getting VS Code on your own computer (h2)

Visit [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "https://code.visualstudio.com/") and follow the
instructions to install it on your computer.

##Example: `welcome.py` (h2)

By now, you should have VS Code installed. You have the option
of either finding the application or opening it up from the terminal.
Recall from [Lab 0](../lab/lab00/ "../lab/lab00/") that you can open a terminal on the school
computers by pressing `Ctrl-Alt-t`.

Let's first create and navigate to a directory called `example`, using
the UNIX commands you learned in [Lab 0](../lab/lab00/ "../lab/lab00/"):

```
mkdir ~/Desktop/example
cd ~/Desktop/example
```


###Opening files (h3)

Now let's open up VS Code!

> 
> For Mac users, you'll most likely find VS Code in `Applications`.
> 
> 
> 

> 
> For Ubuntu users, you'll most likely find VS Code by putting it
> in the search bar.
> 
> 
> 

> 
> For Windows users, you'll most likely find VS Code in `Program Files`.
> 
> 
> 

You can also open VS Code in your current working directory via command line:

```
code .
```

VS Code will open up to a welcome page. Open the explorer (page icon in the top left
corner) then click `EXAMPLE`. To create a new file, either right click below `EXAMPLE`
and select "New File" or click the page icon with a plus in the corner. Let's name our
file `welcome.py`. A pop-up will appear in the bottom right corner prompting you to install
the Python extension. We'll talk more about extensions [later](/articles/vscode/#extensions "/articles/vscode/#extensions"), but just install the
Python extension for now, and ignore any other pop-ups that may appear. Now, we can begin programming!

```
mkdir ~/Desktop/example
cd ~/Desktop/example
```


###Editing files (h3)

Now we have VS Code open, we can begin writing our first Python file.
We'll be writing a short program that prints out a welcome message when
executed. Don't worry, we don't expect you to know any Python yet! All
you have to do is type in the following:

```
def welcome(name):
    print('Welcome to CS61A, %s!' % name)
```

Once you've finished typing, VS Code should look something like this:

![welcome function](assets/vscode-welcome-function.png)

To save, you can just hit `Ctrl-s` (`cmd-s` on Mac) and the white dot by the file name should disappear.

##Example: `welcome.py` (h2)

By now, you should have VS Code installed. You have the option
of either finding the application or opening it up from the terminal.
Recall from [Lab 0](../lab/lab00/ "../lab/lab00/") that you can open a terminal on the school
computers by pressing `Ctrl-Alt-t`.

Let's first create and navigate to a directory called `example`, using
the UNIX commands you learned in [Lab 0](../lab/lab00/ "../lab/lab00/"):

```
mkdir ~/Desktop/example
cd ~/Desktop/example
```


###Running Python (h3)

Back in our terminal, we're currently in our `example` directory.
Let's play around with our code. In the terminal, start by typing

```
python3 -i welcome.py
```

This command does the following:

1. `python3` is the command that starts Python
2. The `-i` flag tells Python to start in **interactive mode**, which
 allows you to type in Python commands from your terminal
3. `welcome.py` is the name of the Python file we want to run

Notice that the Python interpreter says `>>>`. This means Python is
ready to take a command.

Recall that we defined a function called `welcome`. Let's see what it
does! Type in the following:

```
>>> welcome('Laryn')
```

Python will then print out

```
Welcome to CS 61A, Laryn!
```

Our code works! Feel free to try it out with your own name. Ok, now let's close Python by typing in

```
>>> exit()
```

> There are a couple of ways to exit Python. You can type in `exit()`
> or `quit()`. On MacOS and Linux, you can also type in `Ctrl-d` (this
> doesn't work on Windows).
> 
> 

Congratulations, you've edited your first file in VS Code!

#Visual Studio Code (h1)


##Keyboard Shortcuts (h2)

VS Code has many, many keyboard shortcuts. Here are a few useful
ones! (for Mac users, replace all the `Ctrl` sequences with `cmd`, except
for the integrated terminal sequence, which still uses `Ctrl`)

* `Ctrl-`` : open an integrated terminal in VS Code
* `Ctrl-s` : saves the current file
* `Ctrl-x` : cuts the entire line your cursor is on
* `Ctrl-v` : pastes the entire line you cut in the line above your
 cursor OR pastes the selected text in place
* `Ctrl-z` : undo
* `Ctrl-shift-z` : redo
* `tab` : indent a line or a group of lines
* `shift-tab` : dedent a line or a group of lines
* `Ctrl-d` : highlights the current word. For every
 `Ctrl-d` you type after this first word, it will highlight every next
 instance of the word. This allows you to easily rename variables with
 multiple cursors! (Play around with this one, it's fun and very practical!)
* `Ctrl-tab` : moves you to the next tab (`Ctrl` on Mac as well)
* `Ctrl-shift-tab` : moves you to the previous tab (`Ctrl` on Mac as well)
* `Ctrl-f` : search for a word
* `Ctrl-shift-f` : searches through all tabs

##Extensions (h2)

Extensions allow you to customize your text editor. They are pieces of software
written by people like you and me or companies to improve everyone's quality of life.
Extensions can do anything ranging from changing the color scheme, to allowing you
to control Spotify while you code, to letting you share your workspace in real
time with your friends (❌ not on class assignments though ❌)! [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#:~:text=You%20can%20browse%20and%20install,on%20the%20VS%20Code%20Marketplace. "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#:~:text=You%20can%20browse%20and%20install,on%20the%20VS%20Code%20Marketplace.")
is the documentation regarding extensions, but feel free to browse on your own by hitting `Ctrl+shift+x`.

This guide only scratches the surface of VS Code's
functionality. Remember, if there's something you wish VS Code could
do, it probably can. Just Google it!


###Pair Programming (h3)

You can pair program in VSCode using the Live Share extension.

[Download here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare&ssr=false "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare&ssr=false")

Once you and your partner both have the extension installed, you'll need to start a new Live Share session and then explicitly share your code and terminal with each other. See the instructions on the download page for more details on sharing and joining sessions.
