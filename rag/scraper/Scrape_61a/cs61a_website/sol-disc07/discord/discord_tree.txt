##Overview (h2)

CS 61A uses [Discord](https://discord.com "https://discord.com") voice chat during discussion
sections. Please join Discord in advance of your first discussion by following
the setup instructions below. You are not required to join Discord, but someone
from each discussion group should join, and most students will end up joining.

In CS 61A, Discord is **not anonymous**. All members of the class's Discord
server must use their CalNet ID (what comes before `@berkeley.edu` in your
email address) as your server nickname. Anyone else will be removed.

Your discussion group will be assigned its own private voice channel for the
semester. The main purpose of this channel is to talk to the course staff
during discussion. You're welcome to use it at any other time, but please only
message the staff during discussion.

##Setup (h2)

1) Sign up for a Discord account and verify your email address if you don't have an account already. The CS 61A Discord requires a verified email address. If you do not want your Berkeley CalNet ID associated with your existing Discord account, then make a new Discord account just for this class.

2) Join the [CS 61A Discord](https://discord.gg/DunpM5upYs "https://discord.gg/DunpM5upYs")!

3) Check your Direct Messages (panel on the left). A message from the CS61A Verify Bot will appear, asking for your student ID number (e.g. 3012345678).

4) If you are registered in the class, your nickname in the server will be automatically changed to your Berkeley CalNet ID. You will now also have access to your discussion group's private voice channel!

##Channels & Etiquette (h2)

Once you join the server and your nickname is changed, you will be added to a private channel for your discussion group. There is also a `#help` channel that you can use for help requests.

This Discord is a formal, academic space, and it is our expectation that all
posts demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion for
others. Please remember to be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws from
a wide spectrum of valuable experiences.

Please make sure that your status message is appropriate for an academic setting.
