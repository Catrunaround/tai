Several doctests refer to these functions:

```
from operator import add, mul

square = lambda x: x * x

identity = lambda x: x

triple = lambda x: 3 * x

increment = lambda x: x + 1
```

## Higher-Order Functions

### Q1: Product

Write a function called `product` that returns the product of the first `n` terms of a sequence.
Specifically, `product` takes in an integer `n` and `term`, a single-argument function that determines a sequence. 
(That is, `term(i)` gives the `i`th term of the sequence.)
`product(n, term)` should return `term(1) * ... * term(n)`.

```
def product(n, term):
    """Return the product of the first n terms in a sequence.

    n: a positive integer
    term:  a function that takes one argument to produce the term

    >>> product(3, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3
    6
    >>> product(5, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    120
    >>> product(3, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    36
    >>> product(5, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2 * 4^2 * 5^2
    14400
    >>> product(3, increment) # (1+1) * (2+1) * (3+1)
    24
    >>> product(3, triple)    # 1*3 * 2*3 * 3*3
    162
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q productCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qproduct").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q product', "copy-code-python3ok-qproduct");

### Q2: Accumulate

Let's take a look at how `product` is an instance of a more
general function called `accumulate`, which we would like to implement:

```
def accumulate(fuse, start, n, term):
    """Return the result of fusing together the first n terms in a sequence 
    and start.  The terms to be fused are term(1), term(2), ..., term(n). 
    The function fuse is a two-argument commutative & associative function.

    >>> accumulate(add, 0, 5, identity)  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    15
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 5, identity) # 11 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    26
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 0, identity) # 11 (fuse is never used)
    11
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)   # 11 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2
    25
    >>> accumulate(mul, 2, 3, square)    # 2 * 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    72
    >>> # 2 + (1^2 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (3^2 + 1)
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: x + y + 1, 2, 3, square)
    19
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

`accumulate` has the following parameters:

* `fuse`: a two-argument function that specifies how the current term
 is fused with the previously accumulated terms
* `start`: value at which to start the accumulation
* `n`: a non-negative integer indicating the number of terms to fuse
* `term`: a single-argument function; `term(i)` is the `i`th term of the sequence

Implement `accumulate`, which fuses the first `n` terms of the sequence defined
by `term` with the `start` value using the `fuse` function.

For example, the result of `accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)` is

```
add(11,  add(square(1), add(square(2),  square(3)))) =
    11 +     square(1) +    square(2) + square(3)    =
    11 +     1         +    4         + 9            = 25
```

> Assume that `fuse` is commutative, `fuse(a, b) == fuse(b, a)`, and
> associative, `fuse(fuse(a, b), c) == fuse(a, fuse(b, c))`.
> 
> 

Then, implement `summation` (from lecture) and `product` as one-line calls to
`accumulate`.

**Important:** Both `summation_using_accumulate` and `product_using_accumulate`
should be implemented with a single line of code starting with `return`.

```
def summation_using_accumulate(n, term):
    """Returns the sum: term(1) + ... + term(n), using accumulate.

    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, square)
    55
    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, triple)
    45
    >>> # This test checks that the body of the function is just a return statement.
    >>> import inspect, ast
    >>> [type(x).__name__ for x in ast.parse(inspect.getsource(summation_using_accumulate)).body[0].body]
    ['Expr', 'Return']
    """
    return ____

def product_using_accumulate(n, term):
    """Returns the product: term(1) * ... * term(n), using accumulate.

    >>> product_using_accumulate(4, square)
    576
    >>> product_using_accumulate(6, triple)
    524880
    >>> # This test checks that the body of the function is just a return statement.
    >>> import inspect, ast
    >>> [type(x).__name__ for x in ast.parse(inspect.getsource(product_using_accumulate)).body[0].body]
    ['Expr', 'Return']
    """
    return ____

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q accumulate
python3 ok -q summation_using_accumulate
python3 ok -q product_using_accumulateCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qaccumulatepython3ok-qsummation\_using\_accumulatepython3ok-qproduct\_using\_accumulate").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q accumulate\npython3 ok -q summation\_using\_accumulate\npython3 ok -q product\_using\_accumulate', "copy-code-python3ok-qaccumulatepython3ok-qsummation\_using\_accumulatepython3ok-qproduct\_using\_accumulate");

### Q3: Make Repeater

Implement the function `make_repeater` that takes a one-argument function `f`
and a positive integer `n`. It returns a one-argument function, where
`make_repeater(f, n)(x)` returns the value of `f(f(...f(x)...))` in which `f` is
applied `n` times to `x`. For example, `make_repeater(square, 3)(5)` squares 5
three times and returns 390625, just like `square(square(square(5)))`.

```
def make_repeater(f, n):
    """Returns the function that computes the nth application of f.

    >>> add_three = make_repeater(increment, 3)
    >>> add_three(5)
    8
    >>> make_repeater(triple, 5)(1) # 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 1
    243
    >>> make_repeater(square, 2)(5) # square(square(5))
    625
    >>> make_repeater(square, 3)(5) # square(square(square(5)))
    390625
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q make_repeaterCopy✂️
```

 document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qmake\_repeater").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q make\_repeater', "copy-code-python3ok-qmake\_repeater");
